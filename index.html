  <title>The Goofiest Little Cat</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>Get a load of this cat!!</h1>
  <h2></h2>
  <p>This is my cat Nannah Puddin'. Yes, the apostrophe is on her paperwork. Nannah is an American Curl and she is very small. The hallmark feature of American Curls is thir curly little frito ears. Simultaneously adorable and abhorrent. Disgusting. On an unrelated note, at the time of this webpage being made, Nannah has recently undergone oral surgery and had three of her front bottom teeth removed, leaving only gum. Everyone tell Nannah that its barely noticable. Anyway, I will now list my 5 favorite things about Nannah IN ORDER</p>
    <ol>
      <li>She only eats the very center of the food in her bowl</li>
      <li>She refuses to drink out of anything but her favorite XXL mason jar</li>
      <li>She has the biggest little eyeballs</li>
      <li>Her ears. I mean, come on.</li>
      <li>She undisputably has the absolute sweetest personality of any cat</li>
    </ol>
